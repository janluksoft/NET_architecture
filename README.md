# NET architecture

I am sharing my diagram showing the .NET and ambient architecture. 
The environment has many elements and names that have complicated connections and references. 
In fact, they are grouped in logical blocks that I have drawn and presented 
in the picture below and in the file: [NET_architecture_JL.png]
